# Qualtrics Overrides ðŸŽ¨

This repo contains the various JavaScript, CSS, and HTML override files used in Qualtrics surveys at @TheFridayInstitute.

Each sub-directory within [src](src/) houses an individual survey's project files. Located there, too, are common JavaScript files shared between surveys, such as [`get-ip.ts`](src/get-ip.ts), plus an additional TypeScript definition file exposing the Qualtrics JavaScript API.

In particular, these overrides are used to serve the files necessary for running our speedtest implementation.

## `qualtrics.d.ts`

A TypeScript definition, or deceleration file, used to provide a certain level of type safety when using Qualtrics' JavaScript API. Currently, the entire API is represented, but proper comments are describing their functionalities is lacking.

## The Speedtest

### Re-intro

The primary use case of this repo is to house files necessary for our embedded speedtest's operation. At a minimum, this requires one HTML survey element with JavaScript code injected therein. Optionally, a series of CSS overrides may be provided.

In addition to the HTML and JavaScript code, two sets of additional survey logic must be added to a given Qualtrics survey: a series of `embedded data` fields, and a one `web service call`.

### HTML

Within a project's `speedtest.html`, the necessary HTML for the individual speedtest
iframe is located. Note, the
iframe ID here must match the iframe ID within the corresponding JavaScript.

### JavaScript

Within [scripts](scripts/), housed are the custom scripts to be interpolated
into the individual speedtest survey block. To facilitate communication between iframe and parent, we utilize the standard [`window.postMessage()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage); perfect for our purposes, as we control both content domains.

Below is an example of how the custom JavaScript may be called and thereby used in
Qualtrics.

An integral facet used by the JS above is the notion of embedded data fields
within Qualtrics.

Regarding embedded data, a typical speedtest execution is followed by an [ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io/) API call: ipinfo returns JSON object telemetry related to
an input IP address.

### CSS?

Within styles/, _base.css_ is the basal CSS template, used by all surveys. All
other files therein are used for their respective surveys; farm for farm, school
wifi for school wifi, etc..

The custom styles defined here are typically used in Qualtrics as such:

Wherein, the custom CSS is called via the external CSS field.
